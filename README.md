## Discrete Structure Project

A high-speed rail link connecting Kuala Lumpur and Singapore was created in the late 1990s, but it was canceled due to excessive costs. The idea was reintroduced in 2006 by YTL Corporation, operator of the Express Rail Link in Kuala Lumpur, with a predicted speed of 250 km/h (155 mph). Travel time between the two cities was supposed to be reduced to 99 minutes, compared to 4â€“5 hours by road, 7 hours by regular rail service, or 3 hours by air (including travel to and from the airports, check-in, boarding, and other airport procedures). The Malaysian government canceled the project in 2008, citing high costs of more than RM8 billion.


The idea was recognised in 2010 as a high-impact project out of 131 entry-point projects in the Malaysian government's Economic Transformation Programmed Roadmap in an effort to improve economic activity while also increasing economic synergy between two significant regional financial hubs. In December 2010 and January 2011, the practicality and conceptual features of the plan were studied. MyHSR Corp announced that a non-stop high-speed rail express service between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore may travel every 30 minutes from Bandar Malaysia, on the outskirts of downtown Kuala Lumpur, to Jurong East in Singapore. The non-stop express service would take 90 minutes to reach Singapore, and passengers boarding at Bandar Malaysia station might be able to clear Singapore Immigration prior to boarding.


The HSR would also provide a Malaysian domestic service, with the train stopping at all the intermediates at seven Malaysian stations. This service, which is also available every half-hour, would take 120 minutes to complete. Apart from employing aeroplane services, this is one of the easiest ways for both sides of the country to conduct tourism, business, and other activities. Which option, however, takes the quickest time and travels the shortest distance to Singapore?

### Method
We decided to implement graph theory concept.

### Justification
By using graph theory, we are able to use some labelling in the model by applying the concept of vertices and edges which represent the cities or destinations and also the distance from each destination. Graph theory is a very useful concept as it has a lot of real-world applications. For example, graph theory is used to create a solution of routing problems.

In this case study, the problem is to find the minimum path linking Kuala Lumpur and Singapore based on the available routes that already been proposed. There are many routes that could be taken to reach Singapore from Kuala Lumpur. For the starting point, we choose Kuala Lumpur Sentral and the endpoint is Jurong East which is a city in Singapore. The total distance is calculated once the High-Speed Rail arrived in Jurong East City.
